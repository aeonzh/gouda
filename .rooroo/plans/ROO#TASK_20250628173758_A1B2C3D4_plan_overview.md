**Key Dependencies:**
The tasks are largely sequential, following the phases outlined in `docs/project_plan.md`. Frontend tasks depend on their corresponding backend implementations and shared components.

**Assumptions Made:**

- The `docs/project_plan.md` provides a comprehensive and accurate plan for the MVP.
- Supabase will be used for all backend functionalities as specified.
- React Native, Expo, and NativeWind are the chosen technologies for mobile application development.

**Potential Risks:**

- Complexity of Supabase RLS policies for fine-grained access control.
- Integration challenges between shared components and individual applications.
- Performance considerations for large datasets with Supabase auto-generated APIs.
