# Implementation Plan: Multi-Vendor Backend

**Overall Strategy:** This plan breaks down the implementation of the multi-vendor backend into four distinct sub-tasks. The first three tasks involve development work on the database, security policies, and API logic. The final task is to update the documentation to reflect the changes.

**Sub-tasks List:**

- **ROO#SUB_T20250711001928_S001_20250711020716_A1B2:** Database Schema Modification (`rooroo-developer`)
- **ROO#SUB_T20250711001928_S002_20250711020741_C3D4:** Row Level Security (RLS) Policy Implementation (`rooroo-developer`)
- **ROO#SUB_T20250711001928_S003_20250711020749_E5F6:** API and Business Logic Refactoring (`rooroo-developer`)
- **ROO#SUB_T20250711001928_S004_20250711020809_G7H8:** Documentation Update (`rooroo-documenter`)

**Key Dependencies:** The sub-tasks should be completed in the order listed above, as each subsequent task depends on the completion of the previous one.

**Assumptions Made:**

- The application is not in production, so direct schema modifications are acceptable.
- The developer has the necessary permissions to modify the Supabase database and RLS policies.
