# Analysis Report: Database Schema and Migration

**Task ID:** 456

## Summary

This report details the analysis and resolution of a database error in the Gouda application. The initial error, `relation "public.profiles" does not exist`, was caused by unapplied database migrations. The investigation also revealed a need to align the database schema with business requirements, leading to a revised migration.

## Initial Findings

The investigation began with the error `admin side: hook.js:608 Error fetching user role: relation "public.profiles" does not exist`. This error indicated that the `profiles` table was missing from the database.

The following migration files were found in the `supabase/migrations` directory:

- [`20250701100500_create_products_and_categories_tables.sql`](supabase/migrations/20250701100500_create_products_and_categories_tables.sql)
- [`20250701121902_create_carts_and_orders_tables.sql`](supabase/migrations/20250701121902_create_carts_and_orders_tables.sql)
- [`20250705194042_create_profiles_and_addresses_and_add_stock_quantity.sql`](supabase/migrations/20250705194042_create_profiles_and_addresses_and_add_stock_quantity.sql)

The `supabase status` command confirmed that a local Supabase instance was running, but `supabase migration list` failed, suggesting an issue with the local Supabase project's configuration.

## Schema Alignment and Correction

A discussion with the user revealed that the `addresses` table, designed for buyer addresses, was not aligned with the business requirement of tracking business addresses.

To address this, the following actions were taken:

1.  **Schema Revision**: A new migration file, [`20250705194042_create_profiles_and_business_details.sql`](supabase/migrations/20250705194042_create_profiles_and_business_details.sql), was created to replace the old one. This new migration removes the `addresses` table and introduces a `business_details` table to store business-specific information, including addresses.
2.  **RLS Policy Correction**: An error was identified in the RLS policies of the new migration file, where a non-existent `user_id` column was referenced. This was corrected to use the `id` column.
3.  **Database Reset**: The local Supabase database was reset using `supabase db reset`. This command successfully applied all migrations, including the corrected one, resolving the initial error and aligning the database schema with the new requirements.

## Conclusion

The database is now in a consistent state, and the `profiles` table has been successfully created. The schema has been updated to better reflect the application's business logic. The original error should no longer occur.
