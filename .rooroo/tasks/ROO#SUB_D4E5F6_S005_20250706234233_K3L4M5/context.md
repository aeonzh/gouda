# Sub-task: Replace "buyer" in file content

**Goal:** Replace all occurrences of "buyer" with "customer" within all project files.

**Parent Task:** [Main Plan Overview](../../../plans/ROO#TASK_20250706234009_D4E5F6_plan_overview.md)

**Prerequisites:**

- The analysis from sub-task 1 must be complete.
- All file and directory renaming tasks (2, 3, and 4) must be complete.

**Instructions:**

1.  Using the report from sub-task 1, go through each file identified as containing "buyer".
2.  Replace all instances of "buyer" with "customer". Be mindful of case sensitivity (e.g., `Buyer` should become `Customer`).
3.  After replacement, ensure the code compiles and the application runs without errors.
