# Analysis Report: MVP Simplifications for Gouda Project

## Summary

This report reviews the existing project documentation for the Gouda B2B wholesale store platform, identifies core functionalities, and proposes a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scope. The proposed MVP focuses on essential features for both the Buyer and Administrative applications, enabling basic order placement and management. This simplification aims to accelerate time-to-market by deferring advanced features and complex configurations to subsequent iterations.

## Proposed MVP Features

The MVP will focus on the following core functionalities:

### Buyer Application MVP Features

The Buyer application MVP will enable users to:

- **Authentication:** Securely register and log in. Password reset functionality will be simplified or handled externally in the initial release.
- **Product Catalog:** Browse a list of products and view detailed information for each product (description, pricing, availability). Basic search functionality will be included, but advanced filtering may be simplified.
- **Shopping Cart:** Add products to a cart, adjust quantities, and remove items.
- **Order Creation:** Create an order directly from the shopping cart.
- **Order History:** View a list of past orders with their current status.
- **User Profile:** View and edit personal contact information. Management of multiple shipping addresses will be deferred.

### Administrative Application MVP Features

The Administrative application MVP will enable store managers and seller agents to:

- **Authentication:** Securely log in with administrative credentials.
- **Dashboard:** Access a basic overview tailored to their role.
- **Product Management:** View a list of products, add new products, and edit existing product details (focusing on essential fields). Category management will be simplified.
- **Inventory Management:** View current inventory levels and manually adjust stock. Low stock alerts will be deferred.
- **Order Management:** View a list of all orders, view detailed order information, and update order statuses. Seller agents will be able to create orders on behalf of buyers.
- **Customer/Buyer Management:** View a list of registered buyers and their basic details. Adding/editing buyer accounts will be simplified.
- **User Management (Admin):** For higher-level administrators, basic functionality to view administrative users and assign roles will be included for initial setup.
- **Reporting & Analytics:** All detailed reporting and analytics features will be deferred.
- **Settings & Configuration:** All general application settings, pricing rules, shipping methods, and payment gateway configurations will be deferred.

## Impact on Existing Project Plan

The existing [`project_plan.md`](docs/project_plan.md) outlines a comprehensive development roadmap. Implementing the proposed MVP will alter this plan by prioritizing core tasks, simplifying the scope of some features, and deferring others.
