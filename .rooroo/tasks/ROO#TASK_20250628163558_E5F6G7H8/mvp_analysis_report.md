# MVP Simplification Analysis for Gouda Project

## Executive Summary

This report outlines a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scope for the Gouda B2B wholesale store platform, based on a review of the existing project documentation. The proposed MVP focuses on core functionalities essential for a buyer to place an order and for an administrator to manage it, deferring advanced features to future iterations. This approach aims to accelerate time-to-market and gather early user feedback. The existing detailed project plan (`docs/project_plan.md`) will be updated to clearly delineate MVP tasks from future development.

## Introduction

The user requested a review of the project documentation, specifically excluding the `old` folder and focusing on the `docs` folder, to identify areas for simplification towards an MVP. The goal is to streamline the initial release by prioritizing essential features for both the Buyer and Administrative applications.

## Proposed MVP Features

Based on the Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) for the Buyer and Administrative applications, the following features are proposed for the MVP:

### Buyer Application MVP

The Buyer Application MVP will enable users to:

- **User Authentication**: Register, log in, and reset passwords securely.
- **Product Catalog**: Browse products, use basic search, and view detailed product information (including pricing and availability). Advanced filtering and category browsing will be simplified or limited.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add, remove, and update product quantities in a shopping cart.
- **Order Creation**: Create an order directly from the shopping cart.
- **Order History**: View a list of past orders with basic details and status updates.
- **User Profile**: View and edit personal information, and manage a single shipping address.

Features like payment method management, wishlists, notifications, and highly advanced search/filtering will be considered for future iterations.

### Administrative Application MVP

The Administrative Application MVP will provide core tools for store managers and seller agents:

- **Admin Authentication**: Secure login for administrative roles.
- **Basic Dashboard**: A simplified overview with key information relevant to the user's role.
- **Product Management**: View, add, edit, and delete products. Basic category assignment will be supported.
- **Inventory Management**: View current inventory levels and perform simple stock adjustments. Low stock alerts will be deferred.
- **Order Management**: View, search, and filter orders; view order details; and update order statuses. Seller agents will be able to create orders on behalf of buyers.
- **Customer/Buyer Management**: View, add, and edit buyer accounts.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Basic differentiation between Store Manager and Seller Agent roles will be implemented, but dynamic administrative user management will be deferred.

Advanced features such as detailed reporting and analytics, comprehensive user management for higher-level admins, and extensive settings/configuration will be developed in subsequent phases.

## Impact on Existing Project Plan (`docs/project_plan.md`)

The existing `docs/project_plan.md` is a comprehensive, detailed plan. To reflect the MVP scope, each task and subtask within this document will be annotated with either `(MVP)` or `(Future)` to clearly indicate its inclusion in the Minimum Viable Product or its deferral to a later iteration. This approach maintains the integrity of the detailed plan while providing a clear roadmap for the MVP.

**Example of Modified Tasks:**

Original:

```
- [ ] **Task 1.1: Initialize Monorepo Structure**
  - **Description**: Set up a monorepo (e.g., using Expo's built-in monorepo support or a tool like Nx/Lerna) to host both Buyer and Admin applications, and potentially a shared backend/common utilities.
  - **Dependencies**: None
  - **Subtasks**:
    - [ ] 1.1.1: Choose monorepo tool/strategy.
    - [ ] 1.1.2: Create root project directory and initialize monorepo.
    - [ ] 1.1.3: Configure basic monorepo settings (e.g., workspace definitions).
```

Modified (example):

```
- [ ] **Task 1.1: Initialize Monorepo Structure (MVP)**
  - **Description**: Set up a monorepo (e.g., using Expo's built-in monorepo support or a tool like Nx/Lerna) to host both Buyer and Admin applications, and potentially a shared backend/common utilities.
  - **Dependencies**: None
  - **Subtasks**:
    - [ ] 1.1.1: Choose monorepo tool/strategy. (MVP)
    - [ ] 1.1.2: Create root project directory and initialize monorepo. (MVP)
    - [ ] 1.1.3: Configure basic monorepo settings (e.g., workspace definitions). (MVP)
```

This annotation will be applied consistently throughout the `project_plan.md` document.

## Conclusion

By focusing on the identified core functionalities for both the Buyer and Administrative applications, the Gouda project can achieve a valuable MVP. This streamlined approach will allow for quicker deployment, early user feedback, and a more agile development cycle for subsequent feature enhancements. The updated project plan will serve as a clear guide for this iterative development process.
