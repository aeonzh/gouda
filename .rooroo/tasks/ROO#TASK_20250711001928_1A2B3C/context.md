The user wants to modify the backend design to support a multi-vendor marketplace model, similar to Deliveroo, Just Eat, or Uber Eats.

Key requirements:

- Carts and orders must be tied to a single "shop" (business).
- Each shop should manage its own custom product categories, without relying on global categories.
- Business owners should have all the permissions and functionalities of a sales agent, in addition to managing their own shop.

The user has requested these requirements be rephrased into clear, actionable single steps.
