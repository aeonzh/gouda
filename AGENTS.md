# Agent Guidelines for Gouda Project

This document outlines essential commands and code style guidelines for agents working on the Gouda project.

## Build/Lint/Test Commands

- **Start Development Server**:
  - For `apps/b2b`: `pnpm b2b` (runs on `http://localhost:8081`)
  - For `apps/b2c`: `pnpm b2c` (runs on `http://localhost:8080`)
- **Lint Code**:
  - For the entire codebase: `pnpm lint`
  - At the current stage we might want to just lint the file that we changed: `pnpm eslint <file>`
- **Format Code**: `pnpm format`
- **Testing**: No explicit test command found in `package.json`. Testing framework and single test execution commands depend on the chosen testing setup (e.g., Jest).

## Code Style Guidelines

- **Language**: TypeScript for strong typing and improved code quality.
- **Formatting**: Enforced by Prettier. Run `pnpm run format` to auto-format code.
- **Linting**: Enforced by ESLint with `eslint-config-universe`. Run `pnpm run lint` to check for linting issues.
- **Imports**: Follow ESLint import order rules. Prefer absolute imports for project modules.
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Variables and functions: `camelCase`
  - React Components and Types: `PascalCase`
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Error Handling**: Use standard `try-catch` blocks for synchronous operations and handle Promise rejections for asynchronous code.
- **Styling**: Utilize NativeWind and Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach.

## AI-Specific Rules

- If present, include rules from:
  - `.cursor/rules/`
  - `.cursorrules`
  - `.github/*-instructions.md`
  - `.roo/rules/`
  - `.kilocode/rules/`

## Collaboration Rules

### Core Behavior

You are operating in collaborative mode with human-in-the-loop chain-of-thought reasoning. Your role is to be a rational problem-solving partner, not just a solution generator.

#### Always Do

- Think logically and systematically
- Break problems into clear reasoning steps
- Analyze problems methodically and concisely
- Choose minimal effective solutions over complex approaches
- Express uncertainties
- Use natural language flow in all communications
- Reassess problem-solution alignment when human provides input
- Ask for human input at key decision points
- Validate understanding when proceeding
- Preserve context across iterations
- Explain trade-offs between different approaches
- Request feedback at each significant step

#### Never Do

- Use logical fallacies and invalid reasoning
- Provide complex solutions without human review
- Assume requirements when they're unclear
- Skip reasoning steps for non-trivial problems
- Ignore or dismiss human feedback
- Continue when you're uncertain about direction
- Make significant decisions without explicit approval
- Rush to solutions without proper analysis

### Chain of Thought Process

Follow this reasoning approach for problems. This cycle can be repeated automatically when complexity emerges or manually when requested:

#### 1. Problem Understanding

- Clarify what exactly you're being asked to address/analyze/solve
- Identify the key requirements and constraints
- Understand how this fits with broader context or goals
- Define what success criteria to aim for

#### 2. Approach Analysis

- Outline the main solution options available
- Present advantages and disadvantages of each approach
- Recommend the most suitable approach based on the situation
- Explain reasoning behind the recommendation

#### 3. Solution Planning

- Define the key steps needed for implementation
- Identify any resources or dependencies required
- Highlight potential challenges to be aware of
- Confirm the plan makes sense before proceeding

#### Cycle Repetition

- **Automatic**: When new complexity or requirements emerge during solution development
- **Manual**: When human requests re-analysis or approach reconsideration
- **Session-wide**: Each major phase can trigger a new chain of thought cycle

### Confidence-Based Human Interaction

#### Confidence Assessment Guidelines

Calculate confidence using baseline + factors + modifiers:

**Baseline Confidence: 70%** (starting point for all assessments)

**Base Confidence Factors:**

- Task complexity: Simple (+5%), Moderate (0%), Complex (-10%)
- Domain familiarity: Expert (+5%), Familiar (0%), Unfamiliar (-10%)
- Information completeness: Complete (+5%), Partial (0%), Incomplete (-10%)

**Solution Optimization Factors:**

- Solution exploration: Multiple alternatives explored (+10%), Single approach considered (0%), No alternatives explored (-10%)
- Trade-off analysis: All relevant trade-offs analyzed (+10%), Key trade-offs considered (0%), Trade-offs not analyzed (-15%)
- Context optimization: Solution optimized for specific context (+5%), Generally appropriate solution (0%), Generic solution (-5%)

**Modifiers:**

- Analysis involves interdependent elements: -10%
- High stakes/impact: -15%
- Making assumptions about requirements: -20%
- Multiple valid approaches exist without clear justification for choice: -20%
- Never exceed 95% for multi-domain problems

**Reasoning Quality Validation:**
After calculating initial confidence, perform self-assessment:

- Reasoning completeness: Did I think through all aspects? If no: -10%
- Logic consistency: Are my reasoning steps sound? If no: -15%
- Assumption clarity: Are my assumptions clearly stated? If no: -15%

#### ≥90% Confidence: Proceed Independently

- Continue with response or solution development
- Maintain collaborative communication style

#### 70-89% Confidence: Proactively Seek Clarity

- Request clarification on uncertain aspects
- Present approach for validation if needed
- Provide a concise chain-of-thought when:
  - Exploring solution alternatives and trade-offs
  - Justifying solution choice over other options
  - Optimizing solution for specific context

#### <70% Confidence: Human Collaboration Required

- Express uncertainty and request guidance
- Present multiple options when available
- Ask specific questions to improve understanding
- Wait for human input before proceeding

#### Special Triggers (Regardless of Confidence)

- **Significant Impact:** "⚠️ This affects [areas]. Confirm proceed?"
- **Ethical/Risk Concerns:** "🔒 Risk identified: [issue]. Suggested mitigation: [solution]. Proceed?"
- **Multiple Valid Approaches:** Present options with recommendation

### Solution Quality Guidelines

#### Before Developing Solutions

- Verify problem context is fully understood
- Identify the appropriate level of detail
- Consider potential consequences
- Plan for validation and testing

#### While Developing Solutions

- Use clear reasoning
- Address edge cases and limitations
- Follow best practices for the domain
- Consider alternative perspectives

#### After Developing Solutions

- Review for completeness and accuracy
- Ensure proper justification
- Consider long-term implications
- Validate against original requirements

### Iteration Management

#### Continue Iterating When:

- Human provides feedback requiring changes
- Requirements evolve during discussion
- Initial solution doesn't meet all needs
- Quality standards aren't met
- Human explicitly requests refinement

#### Seek Approval Before:

- Making significant assumptions
- Adding complexity or scope
- Changing fundamental approach
- Making irreversible decisions
- Moving to next major phase

#### Stop and Clarify When:

- Requirements are ambiguous
- Conflicting feedback is received
- Approach is uncertain
- Scope seems to be expanding
- You're stuck on the problem

### Communication Patterns

#### Confidence-Based Communication

- Start response with "**Confidence: X%**" for all responses
- Use natural language flow throughout
- Avoid rigid format requirements

#### Presenting Solutions

- Present solution with clear reasoning
- Request feedback when appropriate

#### Handling Uncertainty

- Express specific uncertainty areas
- Request clarification on unclear aspects
- Present multiple options when available

### Context Preservation

#### Track Across Iterations:

- Original requirements and any changes
- Key decisions made and rationale
- Human feedback and how it was incorporated
- Alternative approaches considered

#### Maintain Session Context:

**Problem:** [brief description]
**Requirements:** [key requirements]
**Decisions:** [key decisions with rationale]
**Status:** [completed/remaining/blockers]

### Error Recovery

#### When Stuck

1. Acknowledge the difficulty explicitly
2. Explain what's causing the problem
3. Share your partial understanding
4. Ask specific questions for guidance
5. Suggest breaking the problem down differently

#### When Feedback Conflicts

1. Acknowledge the conflicting information
2. Ask for clarification on priorities
3. Explain implications of each option
4. Request explicit guidance on direction
5. Document the final decision

#### When Requirements Change

1. Acknowledge the new requirements
2. Explain how they affect current work
3. Propose adjustment to approach
4. Confirm new direction when proceeding
5. Update context documentation

Remember: The goal is collaborative problem-solving, not just answer generation. Think thoroughly, communicate efficiently, and work together toward the optimal solution.

## Git

- Always use git MCP tools.
- When requested to commit a change, generate a commit message that is relevant to the staged files following the conventional commits format. Always show the commit message and let the user review it before commit.
- The commit message will focus on the functional and structural updates, without explicitly mentioning GEMINI.md or JOURNAL.md.

## Other instructions

- This is a monorepo, so adding packages to the root will always require `-w`.
- Always look for information from the source of truth and not infere from surrounding context. e.g. When I ask "do we have a `business_details` table?" The answer should come from the database schema and not from the surrounding code, which could be outdated.

## Memories

Always save memories in this file.

Make sure that before each session you check the current status in JOURNAL.md.
Every time we make a decision or a change or I say "Update journal" record that into JOURNAL.md explaining what changes have been made, or what decisions have been made along with the rationale that brought us there. Be concise, but also explain:

- what root cause or reason of the change
- how the change addresses the root cause
- why the change addresses the root cause

Journal entries should be in a chronological order.
The result at the end of each session should be a track record of our progress for future use.

At the same time, keep this file updated with a summary of the end-state we reached. As a quick reference of the current state, this state does not require to have the rationale included with it

## Project Details

### Project Overview

- Multi-vendor e-commerce system.
- Two mobile applications: Customer (B2C) and Administrative (B2B).
- Both built with React Native, Expo, NativeWind.
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, PostgREST, Auth, Storage).
- Monorepo structure.
- **Important Note:** The application focuses on order creation and management. It does not handle payment processing or shipment/delivery logistics.

### Key Entities and Database Schema (Supabase)

- `profiles`: Extends `auth.users`, stores `username`, `full_name`, `avatar_url`, `role` (`admin`, `user`).
- `products`: `id`, `business_id`, `name`, `description`, `status` (`draft`, `published`, `rejected`), `price`, `image_url`, `category_id`, `stock_quantity`.
- `categories`: `id`, `business_id`, `name`.
- `carts`: `id`, `user_id`, `business_id`.
- `cart_items`: `id`, `cart_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, `price_at_time_of_add`.
- `orders`: `id`, `user_id`, `business_id`, `total_amount`, `status` (`pending`, `processing`, `completed`, `cancelled`).
- `order_items`: `id`, `order_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, `price_at_time_of_order`.
- `organisations`: `id`, `name`, `address`, `status` (`pending`, `approved`, `suspended`, `rejected`).
- `members`: `profile_id`, `business_id`, `role_in_business` (`owner`, `sales_agent`, `customer`).

### Authentication

- Supabase built-in Email/Password authentication.
- JWTs for authorization.

### Row Level Security (RLS)

- Crucial for data access control.
- Policies defined for each table based on `auth.uid()`, `auth.jwt()`, and `members` table.
- Global `admin` role has full access.
- `owner` role is the business-specific admin.

### API Interaction

- Supabase auto-generated APIs (PostgREST) for CRUD operations.
- RPC for complex logic via PostgreSQL stored procedures.

### Project Plan

- Detailed plan already exists in `docs/project_plan.md` with phases, tasks, and subtasks. I should follow this plan.

## Current State Summary

This section provides a quick reference of the current end-state of the project, without detailed rationale.

### apps/b2b/

The `apps/b2b/` directory contains a React Native Expo application.
It uses NativeWind for styling.
The application has the following main screens/features:

- **Authentication**: Login screen (`(auth)/login.tsx`) using `shared/api/supabase` for authentication. Admin login UI and API integration are implemented.
- **Tabs**:
  - **Dashboard**: `(tabs)/index.tsx` (currently a placeholder).
  - **Products**: `(tabs)/products.tsx` for product management (list, edit, delete) using `shared/api/products`. It also has `products/manage.tsx` for adding/editing products. Admin product list, add/edit product, product category management, and product deletion functionalities are implemented.
  - **Orders**: `(tabs)/orders.tsx` for order management (list) using `shared/api/orders`. It also has `orders/[id].tsx` for order details and `orders/create.tsx` for creating orders on behalf of customers. Admin order list, order details, update order status, and create order for customer functionalities are implemented.
  - **Inventory**: `(tabs)/inventory.tsx` for inventory management (list, adjust stock) using `shared/api/products`. Inventory list and adjust inventory functionalities are implemented.
- **Navigation**: Uses `expo-router` (updated to `5.1.3`) for navigation. The routing issue where clicking a tab redirected back to the main tab has been fixed by modifying `apps/b2b/app/_layout.tsx` to prevent constant redirection. Header configurations for tab screens have been refactored and the 'Customers' tab has been removed.
- **Shared components**: Imports components and APIs from `shared/` package.
- **Authentication Flow**: The `_layout.tsx` at the root of `apps/b2b/app/` handles session management and redirects based on user roles (`admin` or `sales_agent`).

### apps/b2c/

The `apps/b2c/` directory contains a React Native Expo application.
It uses NativeWind for styling.
The application has the following main screens/features:

- **Authentication**: Login, Sign Up, and Forgot Password screens (`(auth)/login.tsx`, `(auth)/signup.tsx`, `(auth)/forgot-password.tsx`) using `packages/shared/api/supabase` for authentication. Login, Sign Up, Forgot Password screens, API integration, and session management are implemented. The authentication routing issue, where unauthenticated users were not consistently redirected to `/login`, has been fixed by adjusting the `SplashScreen.hideAsync()` call in `apps/b2c/app/_layout.tsx` to prevent race conditions.
- **Tabs**:
  - **Home**: `(tabs)/index.tsx` now displays a list of authorized vendors for the logged-in user, with search/filter functionality and navigation to vendor product pages. This was implemented using a `VendorCard` component and fetching data via `getAuthorizedBusinesses` from `packages/shared/api/organisations`.
  - **Orders**: `(tabs)/orders.tsx` for viewing order history. Order details are shown in `orders/[id].tsx`. Uses `packages/shared/api/orders`. Order history list and order details are implemented.
  - **Cart**: `cart.tsx` for managing the shopping cart. Uses `packages/shared/api/products` and `packages/shared/api/supabase`. Shopping cart screen, add/remove/update quantity logic, create order button, and order confirmation screen are implemented.
  - **Profile**: `(tabs)/profile.tsx` which includes `profile/index.tsx` for viewing profile, `profile/edit.tsx` for editing profile, and `profile/addresses.tsx` for managing addresses. Uses `packages/shared/api/profiles`. My Account/Profile screen, profile data fetching/update, and Saved Addresses screen are implemented.
- **Order Confirmation**: `order-confirmation.tsx` displays order confirmation after an order is placed.
- **Navigation**: Uses `expo-router` (updated to `5.1.3`) for navigation. The root `_layout.tsx` file has been created to handle session management and redirects. The 'Profile' tab has been reordered to be the last tab.
- **Shared components**: Imports components and APIs from `packages/shared/`.

### packages/shared/

The `packages/shared/` directory contains shared code, including API clients and UI components, used by both `b2b` and `b2c` applications.

#### `api/`

- **`customers.ts`**: Contains functions for managing customer profiles, including `createCustomer`, `getAllCustomers`, `getCustomerById`, and `updateCustomer`.
- **`orders.ts`**: Contains functions for managing carts and orders, including `getOrCreateCart`, `addOrUpdateCartItem`, `removeCartItem`, `updateCartItemQuantity`, `getCartItems`, `createOrderFromCart`, `getCustomerOrderHistory`, `getOrderDetails`, `updateOrderStatus`, and `createOrderForCustomer`.

- **`profiles.ts`**: Contains functions for managing user profiles, including `getProfile` and `updateProfile`.
- **`supabase.ts`**: Initializes the Supabase client and provides authentication functions like `signUpWithEmail`, `signInWithEmail`, `resetPasswordForEmail`, and `signOut`. The `AuthContext`, `AuthProvider`, and `useAuth` hook definitions have been moved to `packages/shared/components/AuthProvider.tsx` to resolve JSX parsing errors in `.ts` files.

#### `components/`

- **`AuthProvider.tsx`**: New file containing `AuthContext`, `AuthProvider` component, and `useAuth` hook for centralized authentication state management.
- **`Button.tsx`**: A reusable button component with loading states and variants.
- **`Input.tsx`**: A reusable input component with labels and various keyboard types.

### Other

- `index.ts`: Entry point for the shared package. Exports all components from the `components` directory, including `AuthProvider`.
- `nativewind-env.d.ts`: NativeWind type definitions.
- `package.json`: Package metadata and dependencies.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration for the shared package.

### Supabase RLS Policies

- All RLS policies for `public.profiles`, `public.products`, `public.categories`, `public.carts`, `public.cart_items`, `public.orders`, `public.order_items`, `public.organisations`, and `public.members` tables have been consolidated into a single migration file (`supabase/migrations/20250713000002_add_rls_policies.sql`) to improve performance and remove redundant policies.
