## Project Details

### Project Plan

- Detailed plan already exists in `docs/project_plan.md` with phases, tasks, and subtasks. I should follow this plan.

## Collaboration with other AI agents

- Always read from `tmp/SCRATCHPAD.md` before acting on a file. This gives you context of the ongoing changes that are happening
- After each change to a file, use `tmp/SCRATCHPAD.md` to annotate ongoing changes for a task
