**Changes Made:**

1.  **Routing Fix in `apps/b2b/app/_layout.tsx`**:
    *   **Description**: Modified the `useEffect` hook to prevent an infinite redirection loop. Previously, after a user logged in, the application would constantly redirect to the `/(tabs)` route, overriding any attempts to navigate to other tabs.
    *   **Rationale**: The fix introduces a check (`if (!inTabsGroup)`) to ensure that the redirection to `/(tabs)` only occurs if the user is *not already* within the `(tabs)` group. This allows the `expo-router`'s `Tabs` component to handle internal tab navigation correctly without interference from the main layout's redirection logic.
    *   **Additional Change**: Added `<Stack.Screen name="(tabs)" options={{ headerShown: false }} />` to the main `Stack` component. This ensures that the `(tabs)` group is properly registered within the navigation stack and its header is hidden, as individual tab screens will manage their own headers.

2.  **Header Configuration Refactoring**:
    *   **Description**: Removed `Stack.Screen` header options from individual tab screens (`apps/b2b/app/(tabs)/inventory.tsx`, `apps/b2b/app/(tabs)/orders.tsx`, `apps/b2b/app/(tabs)/products.tsx`).
    *   **Rationale**: The header configuration is now managed at the `(tabs)/_layout.tsx` level or the main `_layout.tsx` level. This refactoring centralizes header control and avoids redundant or conflicting header definitions across multiple tab screens.

3.  **Tab Removal**:
    *   **Description**: The "Customers" tab was removed from `apps/b2b/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`.
    *   **Rationale**: This tab was removed as it was not part of the intended functionality for the B2B application's initial scope.

4.  **Dependency Update**:
    *   **Description**: Updated the `expo-router` dependency from `^5.1.1` to `5.1.3` in `apps/b2b/package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
    *   **Rationale**: This is a minor version update to `expo-router`, likely bringing bug fixes or performance improvements.
