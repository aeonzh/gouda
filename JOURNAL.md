#### Routing Fix, Header Configuration Refactoring, Tab Removal, and Dependency Update

- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**:
  1.  **Routing Fix**: The `useEffect` hook in `apps/b2b/app/_layout.tsx` was causing an infinite redirection loop after user login, preventing navigation to other tabs.
  2.  **Header Configuration Refactoring**: Header options were redundantly defined in individual tab screens, leading to potential conflicts and scattered control.
  3.  **Tab Removal**: The "Customers" tab was present but not part of the B2B application's initial intended functionality.
  4.  **Dependency Update**: `expo-router` was at `^5.1.1`, and a minor version update to `5.1.3` was available, likely containing bug fixes or performance improvements.
- **How the change addresses the root cause**:
  1.  **Routing Fix**: A check (`if (!inTabsGroup)`) was added to the `useEffect` hook to ensure redirection to `/(tabs)` only occurs if the user is not already within the `(tabs)` group. This allows `expo-router`'s `Tabs` component to handle internal tab navigation correctly. Additionally, `<Stack.Screen name="(tabs)" options={{ headerShown: false }} />` was added to the main `Stack` component to properly register the `(tabs)` group and hide its header.
  2.  **Header Configuration Refactoring**: `Stack.Screen` header options were removed from individual tab screens (`apps/b2b/app/(tabs)/inventory.tsx`, `apps/b2b/app/(tabs)/orders.tsx`, `apps/b2b/app/(tabs)/products.tsx`). Header control is now centralized at the `(tabs)/_layout.tsx` or main `_layout.tsx` level.
  3.  **Tab Removal**: The "Customers" tab was removed from `apps/b2b/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`.
  4.  **Dependency Update**: The `expo-router` dependency was updated from `^5.1.1` to `5.1.3` in `apps/b2b/package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- **Why the change addresses the root cause**:
  1.  **Routing Fix**: Prevents the infinite redirection, allowing proper navigation within the B2B application and improving user experience.
  2.  **Header Configuration Refactoring**: Centralizes header management, making the codebase cleaner, more maintainable, and preventing conflicting header definitions.
  3.  **Tab Removal**: Streamlines the application by removing unused functionality, aligning it with the project's current scope.
  4.  **Dependency Update**: Ensures the application benefits from the latest bug fixes and performance improvements in `expo-router`.

#### Debug Journal: B2C Product Display Issue Investigation and Test File Cleanup

- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**: Investigated why the B2C app showed "No products found" for unauthenticated users. The root cause was identified as an RLS policy on products requiring authentication and the B2C app's inability to determine the business context without an authenticated user. This led to a decision to clean up test files to focus on relevant tests for this issue.
- **How the change addresses the root cause**: This entry documents the problem, root cause analysis, and potential solutions. It also details the decision to remove irrelevant test files (`check_members_roles.js`, `temp_check_members_distribution.js`, `diagnostic.js`, `diagnostic_direct.js`, `diagnostic_frontend.js`) and keep relevant ones (`test_frontend_products.js`, `test_simple_products.js`, `test_direct_api.js`, `test_connection.js`) to streamline debugging and future development.
- **Why the change addresses the root cause**: By understanding the RLS policy and business ID resolution issues, a clear path for solution (modifying RLS or requiring authentication) is established. Cleaning up test files ensures that future testing efforts are focused and efficient, directly supporting the resolution of the product display issue.

### Session: Friday, July 18, 2025

#### B2C Product Visibility Fix

- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**: The B2C application failed to display products for logged-in users. The root cause was traced to the `getCustomerBusinessId` function, which could not reliably fetch the `business_id` when a user was a member of multiple businesses, as the `.single()` database query would fail.
- **How the change addresses the root cause**:
  1.  A new, more robust function, `getBusinessIdForUser`, was created in `packages/shared/api/profiles.ts`. This function uses `.limit(1).single()` to ensure it gracefully handles users with multiple business associations by returning the first available `business_id`.
  2.  The product display component at `apps/b2c/app/(tabs)/products.tsx` was updated to use the new `getBusinessIdForUser` function.
- **Why the change addresses the root cause**: The `getBusinessIdForUser` function guarantees that a valid `business_id` is always returned for any logged-in user, allowing the application to consistently fetch and display the product catalog. This resolves the visibility issue and makes the B2C app functional again, as verified with Playwright testing.

### Session: Saturday, July 19, 2025

#### RLS Policy Security Fix, B2C Authentication Routing Fix, and RLS Policy Fix for Infinite Recursion

- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**:
  1.  **RLS Policy Security Fix**: The Row Level Security (RLS) policies in `supabase/migrations/20250714000003_rls_policies_setup.sql` were insecurely referencing `auth.jwt():user_metadata:role` for access control. `user_metadata` is user-editable, making it an unreliable and unsafe source for security decisions.
  2.  **B2C Authentication Routing Fix**: The B2C application was not consistently redirecting unauthenticated users to the `/login` route. This was due to a race condition where `SplashScreen.hideAsync()` was being called within the `onAuthStateChange` listener, potentially interfering with the routing logic before the session was fully established.
  3.  **RLS Policy Fix: Infinite Recursion in profiles_select_access**: The `profiles_select_access` RLS policy in `supabase/migrations/20250714000003_rls_policies_setup.sql` was causing an infinite recursion error due to a circular dependency in its `EXISTS` clause. This prevented proper data retrieval for profiles. This issue persisted even after initial attempts to simplify the policy, indicating a deeper circular dependency, likely involving the `members_select_access` policy and the `getBusinessIdForUser` function, which itself queries the `members` table. The policy was further simplified to only allow users to see their own non-soft-deleted profiles and admins to see all non-soft-deleted profiles.

- **How the change addresses the root cause**:
  1.  **RLS Policy Security Fix**: All instances of `auth.jwt():user_metadata:role` within the RLS policies have been replaced with a secure check against the `profiles.role` column in the `public.profiles` table. This leverages the existing, authoritative role information stored directly in the database.
  2.  **B2C Authentication Routing Fix**: The call to `SplashScreen.hideAsync()` was removed from the `onAuthStateChange` listener in `apps/b2c/app/_layout.tsx`. It is now exclusively called once after the initial `supabase.auth.getSession()` check and `setLoading(false)` is complete.
  3.  **RLS Policy Fix: Infinite Recursion in profiles_select_access**: A new `SECURITY DEFINER` helper function, `public.get_user_role_by_id()`, was introduced in `supabase/migrations/20250714000003_rls_policies_setup.sql`. This function securely retrieves the user's role by bypassing RLS on the `profiles` table within the function itself. Another `SECURITY DEFINER` helper function, `public.get_auth_user_business_ids()`, was also introduced to securely retrieve the business IDs associated with the authenticated user (if they are an 'owner' or 'sales_agent') by bypassing RLS on the `members` table within the function itself. The `profiles_select_access` policy was then modified to utilize these new helper functions, ensuring that the business ID and role lookups are performed without triggering recursive RLS checks. The policy was further simplified to `deleted_at IS NULL AND (((select auth.uid()) = id) OR (public.get_user_role_by_id((select auth.uid())) = 'admin'))` to break the recursion and allow basic profile access.

- **Why the change addresses the root cause**:
  1.  **RLS Policy Security Fix**: This change eliminates the security vulnerability by ensuring that RLS policies rely on a trusted, server-controlled source of truth for user roles (`profiles.role`) rather than a client-editable one (`user_metadata`). This significantly enhances the security posture of the application's data access control.
  2.  **B2C Authentication Routing Fix**: By ensuring `SplashScreen.hideAsync()` is called only after the initial session determination, the routing logic has a stable state to evaluate, preventing the race condition and ensuring that unauthenticated users are reliably redirected to the login screen.
  3.  **RLS Policy Fix: Infinite Recursion in profiles_select_access**: This approach definitively breaks the recursion by providing secure and non-recursive methods for the `profiles_select_access` policy to determine business membership and user roles. The simplification of the policy to only allow self-access and admin access is a temporary measure to isolate the recursion, allowing us to confirm the fix before reintroducing more complex business logic. This should resolve the persistent internal server error related to profile selection and allow products to be displayed correctly.

#### Reintroducing Full Logic for profiles_select_access RLS Policy

- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**: The `profiles_select_access` RLS policy was temporarily simplified to `deleted_at IS NULL AND (((select auth.uid()) = id) OR (public.get_user_role_by_id((select auth.uid())) = 'admin'))` to break an infinite recursion. This simplification restricted profile access more than intended, only allowing users to see their own profiles or admins to see all profiles. The original intent was to also allow business owners and sales agents to view profiles within their business.
- **How the change addresses the root cause**: The `profiles_select_access` policy in `supabase/migrations/20250714000003_rls_policies_setup.sql` was updated to reintroduce the logic for business owners/sales agents to view profiles within their business. This was achieved by adding an `OR` condition that checks if the `profiles.id` is associated with a business ID that the authenticated user (owner or sales agent) is also a member of, leveraging the `public.get_auth_user_business_ids()` helper function.
- **Why the change addresses the root cause**: This change restores the intended functionality of the `profiles_select_access` policy, allowing business owners and sales agents to manage profiles relevant to their business operations. By using the `SECURITY DEFINER` helper function `public.get_auth_user_business_ids()`, the policy avoids reintroducing the infinite recursion issue, as the helper function securely retrieves business IDs without triggering RLS on the `members` table. This ensures correct and secure data access for all relevant user roles.

### Session: Saturday, July 19, 2025

#### Supabase "Invalid URL" Error Resolution

- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**: The B2C application was consistently throwing a "Server Error: Invalid URL" related to Supabase initialization, despite `console.log` statements showing correct `supabaseUrl` and `supabaseAnonKey` values. The root cause was likely a caching or bundling issue within Expo's environment variable handling, preventing the `createClient` function from correctly receiving the `Constants.expoConfig?.extra` values.
- **How the change addresses the root cause**: The issue was resolved by a series of debugging steps that included:
  1.  Adding and then removing `console.log` statements with type and length checks.
  2.  Temporarily hardcoding the Supabase URL and Anon Key directly into `packages/shared/api/supabase.ts` (which resolved the issue).
  3.  Reverting the hardcoded values back to `Constants.expoConfig?.extra` (which surprisingly continued to work).
  4.  Removing a temporary dummy field added to `apps/b2c/app.config.ts` that was intended to force Expo to re-evaluate its configuration.
      The combination of these actions, particularly the hardcoding and subsequent reversion, seems to have forced Expo's build system to correctly process and bundle the environment variables.
- **Why the change addresses the root cause**: The debugging process, though iterative, effectively "refreshed" Expo's understanding of the environment variables. The temporary hardcoding likely bypassed the problematic caching, and once the cache was cleared or rebuilt, the `Constants.expoConfig` method began working as intended. This indicates the problem was not with the values themselves, but with their propagation through the Expo build pipeline.

### Session: Sunday, July 20, 2025

#### TypeScript Build Fix for Shared Components (Context: Component Import Simplification)

- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**: The primary goal was to simplify component imports in the B2C application from specific file paths (e.g., `packages/shared/components/Input`) to a more consolidated path (e.g., `packages/shared/components`). To achieve this, a barrel file (`packages/shared/components/index.ts`) was created to re-export all components from the `components` directory, and `packages/shared/index.ts` was updated to export from this new barrel file.

  However, this change led to a TypeScript build error (`TS6307: File '...' is not listed within the file list of project '...'`) for `packages/shared/components/index.ts`. The root cause of this error was that the `packages/shared/tsconfig.json`'s `include` array only specified `.tsx` files (`"components/**/*.tsx"`) within the `components` directory, overlooking `.ts` files like the newly created `index.ts`.

- **How the change addresses the root cause**: The `packages/shared/tsconfig.json` file was modified. Specifically, the line `"components/**/*.tsx",` in the `include` array was changed to:

```
    "components/**/*.tsx",
    "components/**/*.ts",
```

This change explicitly tells the TypeScript compiler to include all `.ts` files within the `components` directory for compilation, alongside the existing `.tsx` files.

- **Why the change addresses the root cause**: By including `.ts` files in the `components` directory, the TypeScript compiler can now correctly find and process the `packages/shared/components/index.ts` barrel file. This resolves the `TS6307` error, allowing the `shared` package to build successfully and enabling the desired simplified module resolution for components imported from `packages/shared/components`.

### Session: Monday, July 21, 2025

#### Implement Authorized Vendor List on B2C Home Page

- **What were we trying to do**: Implement the B2C home page (`apps/b2c/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`) to display a list of authorized vendors for the logged-in user, as per the `docs/tasks/b2c_home_page_plan.md`.
- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**: The B2C home page was a placeholder. The goal was to populate it with dynamic data representing authorized vendors and provide search/filter functionality.
- **How the change addresses the root cause**:
  1.  A `VendorCard` component was created to render individual vendor information.
  2.  The `apps/b2c/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` component was updated to:
      - Fetch authorized vendors using `getAuthorizedBusinesses` from `packages/shared/api/profiles.ts`.
      - Manage loading, error, and empty states.
      - Implement search/filter functionality based on vendor name and address.
      - Use a `FlatList` to display the `VendorCard` components.
      - Set up navigation to a dynamic product page (`/products/[vendorId]`) when a vendor card is pressed.
- **Why the change addresses the root cause**: This implementation transforms the placeholder home page into a functional entry point for B2C users, allowing them to discover and access products from their authorized vendors. The search and filter capabilities enhance usability, and the navigation ensures a seamless user experience within the closed-discovery multi-vendor model.

#### Fix for `useAuth` not a function error and AuthProvider Refactoring

- **What were we trying to do**: Resolve the `(0 , _supabase.useAuth) is not a function` error encountered after implementing the authorized vendor list, and refactor the authentication provider for better code organization.
- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**: The `useAuth` hook, `AuthContext`, and `AuthProvider` were initially defined directly within `packages/shared/api/supabase.ts`. This caused a `SyntaxError` because JSX syntax (used in `AuthProvider`) is not allowed in `.ts` files unless specifically configured, and the `api` directory was not set up for JSX parsing. This led to `useAuth` not being properly exported or recognized as a function.
- **How the change addresses the root cause**:
  1.  A new file, `packages/shared/components/AuthProvider.tsx`, was created to house the `AuthContext`, `AuthProvider` component, and `useAuth` hook. This separates the JSX-containing code into a `.tsx` file, which is correctly parsed for JSX.
  2.  The original definitions of `AuthContext`, `AuthProvider`, and `useAuth` were removed from `packages/shared/api/supabase.ts`.
  3.  `packages/shared/components/index.ts` was updated to export `AuthProvider` from the new `AuthProvider.tsx` file.
  4.  The import statement in `apps/b2c/app/_layout.tsx` was updated to import `AuthProvider` from `packages/shared/components`.
  5.  `packages/shared/tsconfig.json` was updated to include `.ts` files in the `components` directory, resolving a build error related to the new `index.ts` barrel file.
- **Why the change addresses the root cause**: By moving the JSX-containing `AuthProvider` and related context/hook definitions to a `.tsx` file, the `SyntaxError` is resolved. This ensures that `useAuth` is correctly defined, exported, and imported, making the authentication context available throughout the B2C application as intended. This adheres to best practices by separating concerns and ensuring proper file type handling for JSX. The `tsconfig.json` update ensures all necessary files are compiled.

#### Shared Components Import Simplification and New ShoppingCartIcon

- **What were we trying to do**: Simplify component imports in the B2C application and introduce a new `ShoppingCartIcon` component.
- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**: Imports for shared components were verbose, pointing to individual files (e.g., `packages/shared/components/Button`). The goal was to consolidate these imports. Additionally, a `ShoppingCartIcon` was needed for the B2C home page header.
- **How the change addresses the root cause**:
  1.  A new barrel file, `packages/shared/components/index.ts`, was created to re-export all components from the `components` directory.
  2.  `packages/shared/index.ts` was updated to export from this new barrel file.
  3.  Imports in `apps/b2c/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`, `apps/b2c/app/cart.tsx`, and `apps/b2c/app/order-confirmation.tsx` were updated to use the simplified import path (e.g., `packages/shared/components`).
  4.  A new `ShoppingCartIcon.tsx` component was added to `packages/shared/components` and exported via the barrel file.
- **Why the change addresses the root cause**: This change significantly cleans up import statements across the B2C application, making the codebase more maintainable and readable. The new `ShoppingCartIcon` provides a dedicated, reusable component for cart navigation.

### Session: Monday, July 21, 2025

#### Refactor API: Separate Customer and Organization APIs

- **What were we trying to do**: Improve the organization and maintainability of the API layer by separating customer and organization related functions into their own dedicated files.
- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**: Previously, `packages/shared/api/profiles.ts` contained functions related to user profiles, business details, customers, and organizations. This made the file large and less focused. The goal was to adhere to the single responsibility principle and improve code clarity.
- **How the change addresses the root cause**:
  1.  Created a new file `packages/shared/api/customers.ts` and moved all customer-related API functions (`createCustomer`, `getAllCustomers`, `getcustomerById`, `updateCustomer`) and the `Profile` interface (as it's used by customer functions) into it.
  2.  Created a new file `packages/shared/api/organisations.ts` and moved all organization-related API functions (`getAuthorizedBusinesses`, `getCustomerBusinessId`) and the `Organisation` interface into it.
  3.  Updated `packages/shared/api/profiles.ts` to only contain functions directly related to user profiles (`getProfile`, `updateProfile`, `getBusinessIdForUser`).
  4.  Updated `apps/b2c/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` to import `Organisation` from the new `packages/shared/api/organisations.ts`.
  5.  Updated `AGENTS.md` with new instructions for commit messages and data source verification.
  6.  Removed shopping cart icon from the B2C home page plan in `docs/tasks/b2c_home_page_plan.md` as it was no longer relevant to the current task.
- **Why the change addresses the root cause**: This refactoring improves code organization, readability, and maintainability by clearly separating concerns within the API layer. It makes it easier to locate and manage functions related to specific entities (customers, organizations, profiles) and reduces the cognitive load when working with these modules. The updates to `apps/b2c/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` and `AGENTS.md` ensure that the application and agent guidelines reflect these structural changes.

#### Implement Storefront Page and Rename VendorCard to StorefrontCard

- **What were we trying to do**: Implement a dedicated page to display products for a selected store and ensure consistent naming conventions across the application.
- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**: The B2C
  application needed a way to display products specific to a chosen vendor. To maintain clear terminology and consistency, the new page was named "Storefront Page," and the component leading to it was renamed from `VendorCard` to `StorefrontCard`.
- **How the change addresses the root cause**:
  1.  A new directory `apps/b2c/app/storefront/` was created.
  2.  The `apps/b2c/app/storefront/[id].tsx` file was created to serve as the Storefront Page. This page fetches and displays products and categories for a given `storeId` (business ID), includes search and category filtering, and navigates to product details.
  3.  The `VendorCard` component within `apps/b2c/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` was renamed to `StorefrontCard`.
  4.  The navigation logic in `apps/b2c/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` was updated to direct to `/storefront/[vendorId]` when a `StorefrontCard` is pressed.
  5.  The `docs/tasks/b2c_store_product_listing_plan.md` was updated to reflect the new "Storefront Page" and "StorefrontCard" terminology.

- **Why the change addresses the root cause**: This implementation provides the necessary functionality for users to browse products from specific vendors. The consistent naming (`StorefrontCard` leading to `StorefrontPage`) improves code readability and maintainability, making the application's structure more intuitive.

### Session: Tuesday, July 22, 2025

#### Fix for "StorefrontCard is not defined" error

- **What were we trying to do**: Resolve the `StorefrontCard is not defined` error after renaming `VendorCard` to `StorefrontCard`.
- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**: The component definition in `apps/b2c/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` was still `const VendorCard`, while the usage was `StorefrontCard`. This caused the `ReferenceError`.
- **How the change addresses the root cause**: Renamed `const VendorCard` to `const StorefrontCard` in `apps/b2c/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`.
- **Why the change addresses the root cause**: Ensures consistency between the component definition and its usage, resolving the `ReferenceError`.

#### Fix for routing to storefront being broken

- **What were we trying to do**: Enable proper navigation to the `storefront/[id]` route in the B2C application.
- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**: The routing logic in `apps/b2c/app/_layout.tsx` was implicitly redirecting authenticated users back to the `(tabs)` group, as it didn't explicitly account for other top-level routes like `storefront/[id]`.
- **How the change addresses the root cause**: Modified `apps/b2c/app/_layout.tsx` to introduce `inStorefrontGroup` and updated the redirection logic to allow navigation to `storefront` routes for authenticated users.
- **Why the change addresses the root cause**: This change ensures that the `storefront` route is recognized and allowed, preventing the router from redirecting away from it and enabling correct navigation.

#### Fix for "invalid input syntax for type uuid: 'some_user_id'" and "session is not defined" errors in storefront/[id].tsx

- **What were we trying to do**: Resolve errors related to invalid user ID and undefined session in `storefront/[id].tsx`.
- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**:
  1.  The `getAuthorizedBusinesses` function was being called with a hardcoded string `'some_user_id'`, which is not a valid UUID, leading to the "invalid input syntax" error.
  2.  The `session` variable was not correctly defined or accessible within the component's scope, leading to "session is not defined" errors.
- **How the change addresses the root cause**:
  1.  Imported `useAuth` from `packages/shared/components/AuthProvider.tsx` in `apps/b2c/app/storefront/[id].tsx`.
  2.  Used `session?.user?.id || ''` to pass the actual user ID to `getAuthorizedBusinesses`.
  3.  Explicitly added `const { session } = useAuth();` at the beginning of the `StorefrontPage` component to ensure `session` is properly initialized and accessible.
- **Why the change addresses the root cause**: Ensures a valid user ID is used for API calls and that the `session` object is correctly available within the component, resolving data fetching and runtime errors.

### Session: Wednesday, July 23, 2025

#### Fix for Invalid UUID in Product and Category Fetching

- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**: The error occurred because an empty string was being passed as a `business_id` to Supabase queries, which expect a valid UUID. This was due to two main reasons:
  1.  In `apps/b2c/app/(tabs)/products.tsx`, the `useEffect` hook fetching the `businessId` was not explicitly handling cases where `user` or `user.id` might be `null` or `undefined` before calling `getBusinessIdForUser`.
  2.  The `getCategories` function in `packages/shared/api/products.ts` did not have the same check for a valid `business_id` as `getProducts`, allowing an empty string to be used in the Supabase query.
- **How the change addresses the root cause**:
  1.  In `apps/b2c/app/(tabs)/products.tsx`, the `useEffect` hook was modified to explicitly check `if (user && user.id)` before calling `getBusinessIdForUser`. If `user` or `user.id` is not available, `setBusinessId(null)` is called, ensuring that `businessId` is `null` and not an empty string.
  2.  In `packages/shared/api/products.ts`, the `getCategories` function was updated to include a check `if (!business_id) { return []; }` at the beginning, similar to `getProducts`.
- **Why the change addresses the root cause**: These changes ensure that all Supabase queries requiring a `business_id` are only executed with a valid UUID. By preventing empty strings from being passed as UUIDs, the "invalid input syntax" error is resolved, leading to more robust data fetching in the B2C application.

#### Product Details Page Navigation and Route Correction

- **What were we trying to do**: Ensure correct navigation to the product details page in the B2C app, preventing it from appearing as a tab while maintaining proper routing.
- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**: Initially, clicking a product redirected to the home screen because `products/[id].tsx` was outside the `(tabs)` directory, causing `expo-router` navigation issues. Moving it _into_ `(tabs)` resolved the redirection but made the product details page appear as an unwanted tab. The root cause was the incorrect placement of the product details route relative to the tab navigation structure and the need for explicit route handling in `_layout.tsx`.
- **How the change addresses the root cause**:
  1.  The `products` directory (containing `[id].tsx`) was initially moved from `apps/b2c/app/` to `apps/b2c/app/(tabs)/products/` to fix the redirection issue.
  2.  Subsequently, to prevent it from appearing as a tab, the `products` directory (containing `[id].tsx`) was moved back from `apps/b2c/app/(tabs)/products` to `apps/b2c/app/products`.
  3.  The `apps/b2c/app/_layout.tsx` file was updated to explicitly include `products/[id]` as an allowed route for authenticated users.
- **Why the change addresses the root cause**: The initial move into `(tabs)` temporarily fixed the navigation by making it a child route. The subsequent move back out, combined with explicit route inclusion in `_layout.tsx`, ensures the product details page is treated as a standalone route. This allows `expo-router` to correctly handle the navigation stack, providing the intended user experience where the product details page is a separate screen, not a tab, and is accessible directly without unintended redirects.

### Session: Friday, July 25, 2025

#### Enhance Storefront Product Filtering, Navigation, and Seed Data

- **What were we trying to do**: Improve product filtering in the B2C storefront, refine navigation logic, and update seed data generation for product images.
- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**:
  1.  **Product Filtering**: Products in the B2C storefront were not being filtered by their `status`, potentially showing non-published items.
  2.  **Navigation Refinement**: The B2C application's `_layout.tsx` needed to explicitly handle `storefront` and `products/[id]` routes to ensure correct navigation and prevent unintended redirects for authenticated users.
  3.  **Seed Data Improvement**: The `faker.image.url()` function in `seed.ts` was deprecated or not providing suitable image URLs, requiring an update to a more reliable image source.
  4.  **Debugging**: Added console logs to `apps/b2c/app/profile/index.tsx` and `apps/b2c/app/storefront/[id].tsx` to aid in debugging.
- **How the change addresses the root cause**:
  1.  **Product Filtering**:
      - Modified `packages/shared/api/products.ts` to add a `status` parameter to the `getProducts` function, allowing filtering by product status.
      - Updated `apps/b2c/app/storefront/[id].tsx` to pass `status: 'published'` when fetching products for a storefront, ensuring only published products are displayed.
  2.  **Navigation Refinement**:
      - Updated `apps/b2c/app/_layout.tsx` to include `inStorefrontGroup` and `inProductsDetailGroup` in the authentication redirection logic, ensuring that authenticated users are not redirected away from these valid routes.
      - Adjusted `Stack.Screen` definitions in `apps/b2c/app/_layout.tsx` to correctly handle `storefront` and `products/[id]` routes.
  3.  **Seed Data Improvement**:
      - Updated `seed.ts` to use `faker.image.urlPicsumPhotos()` instead of `faker.image.url()` for generating product image URLs, providing more consistent and relevant images.
  4.  **Debugging**:
      - Added `console.log` statements to `apps/b2c/app/profile/index.tsx` to trace profile fetching and session status.
      - Added `console.log` statements to `apps/b2c/app/storefront/[id].tsx` to monitor `storeId`, fetched categories, and products.
- **Why the change addresses the root cause**:
  1.  **Product Filtering**: Ensures that the B2C storefront only displays products that are explicitly marked as 'published', providing a more accurate and controlled product catalog for customers.
  2.  **Navigation Refinement**: Improves the user experience by preventing unexpected redirects and allowing seamless navigation to storefronts and product detail pages for authenticated users. This makes the navigation flow more robust and predictable.
  3.  **Seed Data Improvement**: Provides more realistic and consistent image data for seeded products, which is beneficial for development and testing environments.
  4.  **Debugging**: The added logs provide valuable insights into the application's behavior, making it easier to diagnose and resolve future issues related to authentication, profile fetching, and product display.

#### Fix Profile Navigation Redirection Issue

- **What were we trying to do**: Fix the bug where buttons in the profile screen don't navigate to the right screens (Edit Profile and Manage Addresses buttons were redirecting to the tab index instead of the correct pages).
- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**: The root cause was identified in the redirection logic in `apps/b2c/app/_layout.tsx`. The authentication redirection logic was redirecting all non-tab routes (except storefront and products detail) back to the tabs, which included profile routes like `/profile/edit` and `/profile/addresses`. This caused users to be redirected away from profile sub-screens back to the main profile tab.
- **How the change addresses the root cause**: Modified the redirection logic in `apps/b2c/app/_layout.tsx` by adding `segments[0] !== 'profile'` to the condition that checks whether to redirect to tabs. This prevents the app from redirecting users away from profile routes while maintaining the existing redirection behavior for other routes. The specific change was in the useEffect hook that handles authentication-based redirection.
- **Why the change addresses the root cause**: By excluding profile routes from the general redirection logic, users can now successfully navigate to and remain on profile sub-screens like Edit Profile and Manage Addresses. This targeted fix maintains the overall navigation structure while allowing profile-specific routes to function as intended, resolving the navigation issue without disrupting other parts of the application.

#### Debugging and Fixing "Empty Cart" Issue

- **What were we trying to do**: Resolve a bug where the shopping cart in the B2C application always appeared empty, despite items being successfully added to the database. This involved extensive debugging of data fetching, API responses, and database interactions.

- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**:
  The root cause of the "empty cart" issue was a subtle mismatch between the data structure returned by the Supabase API and the data structure expected by the frontend TypeScript code. Specifically, when performing a join operation to fetch `product` details along with `cart_items`, the Supabase PostgREST API returns the joined `product` data under a key named after the joined table (e.g., `products`). However, the frontend's `CartItem` interface and rendering logic expected this nested product object to be under a singular key (e.g., `product`). This discrepancy caused the frontend's filtering logic (`.filter((item) => item.product)`) to filter out all cart items because `item.product` was always `undefined`.

  A secondary issue was a race condition in `getOrCreateCart` and a missing unique constraint in the `carts` table, which prevented robust upsert operations and contributed to data inconsistency.

- **How the change addresses the root cause**:
  1.  **Product Interface Update**: The `Product` interface in `packages/shared/api/products.ts` was updated to include the `status` field, ensuring type consistency with the database schema.
  2.  **Supabase Alias for Product Data**: In `packages/shared/api/orders.ts`, the `getCartItems` function's Supabase query was modified to use an alias for the joined `products` table. Specifically, `products(...)` was changed to `product:products(...)`. This instructs Supabase to return the nested product object under the key `product` (singular), matching the frontend's expectation.
      **Detailed Explanation of `product:products(...)`**:
      In Supabase, when you perform a `select` with a join (e.g., `select('*, products(*)')`), PostgREST (Supabase's API layer) by default returns the joined table's data under a key that is the plural name of the table. So, `products(*)` would result in a JSON structure like:
      ```json
      {
        "id": "cart_item_id",
        "product_id": "product_id",
        // ... other cart_item fields
        "products": {
          // Key is 'products' (plural)
          "id": "product_id",
          "name": "Product Name"
          // ... other product fields
        }
      }
      ```
      However, our frontend `CartItem` interface in `apps/b2c/app/cart.tsx` and the corresponding logic (e.g., `item.product`) expected the key to be `product` (singular):
      ```typescript
      interface CartItem {
        product: Product; // Expects 'product' (singular)
        quantity: number;
      }
      ```
      By changing the select statement to `product:products(...)`, we are telling PostgREST to alias the `products` relationship. The syntax `new_key:original_table_name(columns_to_select)` allows us to rename the key under which the joined data appears in the JSON response.
      Thus, the API response now looks like this, correctly matching the frontend's `CartItem` interface:
      ```json
      {
        "id": "cart_item_id",
        "product_id": "product_id",
        // ... other cart_item fields
        "product": {
          // Key is now 'product' (singular)
          "id": "product_id",
          "name": "Product Name"
          // ... other product fields
        }
      }
      ```
      This was the critical fix that allowed the frontend to correctly identify and process the nested product data.
  3.  **UI Data Refresh Logic**: The `updateCartItemQuantity` and `removeCartItem` functions in `apps/b2c/app/cart.tsx` were updated to call `fetchCartItems()` after a successful API operation instead of manipulating local state. This ensures the UI always reflects the latest data from the server, preventing stale data issues.
  4.  **Robust Cart Creation/Retrieval**: In `packages/shared/api/orders.ts`, the `getOrCreateCart` function was refactored to use a single `upsert` operation with `onConflict: 'user_id, business_id'`. This atomic operation eliminates the race condition that could occur with a separate `select` followed by an `insert`.
  5.  **Database Unique Constraint**: A new database migration file, `supabase/migrations/20250805120000_add_unique_constraint_to_carts.sql`, was created to add a `UNIQUE (user_id, business_id)` constraint to the `carts` table. This constraint is essential for the `upsert` operation in `getOrCreateCart` to work correctly, as `upsert` requires a unique constraint to determine if a row should be updated or inserted.

- **Why the change addresses the root cause**:
  1.  **Product Interface Consistency**: Ensures that the TypeScript types align with the actual data structure returned by the API, preventing runtime errors and improving developer experience.
  2.  **Supabase Alias**: Directly addresses the data key mismatch between the API response and the frontend's expected structure. By aliasing `products` to `product`, the frontend's existing logic (e.g., `.filter((item) => item.product)`) now correctly identifies and uses the product data associated with each cart item, making the cart items visible.
  3.  **UI Refresh**: Guarantees data consistency across the application by always refetching the cart state from the source of truth (the database) after any modification. This prevents scenarios where the UI might show outdated information.
  4.  **Atomic Upsert**: The `upsert` operation makes the `getOrCreateCart` function more robust and resilient to race conditions, ensuring that a cart is always correctly created or retrieved, even under concurrent requests.
  5.  **Database Integrity**: The unique constraint on `carts` is fundamental for the `upsert` operation to work as intended, enforcing data integrity and preventing duplicate cart entries for the same user and business.

  Collectively, these changes resolved the multifaceted "empty cart" bug by fixing data structure mismatches, enhancing UI update logic, and improving database interaction robustness.

#### Cart Display Bug Final Resolution

- **What were we trying to do**: Resolve the persistent "Unknown product" display issue in the B2C cart, which had been fixed and then regressed due to product type mismatches between Supabase API responses and TypeScript definitions.
- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**: The Supabase join query `product:products!left(...)` always returns the joined product data as an array structure, even when containing a single product. Initially, some fixes assumed a single object, which caused mismatches. The root cause was an inconsistent interface definition between the `RawCartItemFromSupabase` TypeScript type (expecting `Product | null`) and the actual API response data structure (returning `Product[]`). This mismatch led to `undefined` product values when the array logic was applied incorrectly.
- **How the change addresses the root cause**:
  1. **Robust Interface Definition**: Updated `RawCartItemFromSupabase.product` to `null | Product | Product[]` to handle all possible response variants from Supabase.
  2. **Adaptive Mapping Logic**: Modified the `getCartItems` mapping logic to correctly extract products:
     ```typescript
     product: Array.isArray(item.product)
       ? (item.product.length > 0 ? (item.product[0] as Product) : undefined)
       : (item.product as Product | undefined),
     ```
  3. **Simplified Business Validation**: Removed redundant business association checks in `createOrderFromCart`, as cart operations already handle business relationships through unique constraints.
- **Why the change addresses the root cause**: By handling both array and single object scenarios in the mapping logic, we ensured compatibility with Supabase's join behavior while maintaining TypeScript correctness. The cart now correctly displays product names by extracting the first product from an array or using a single product object when available. The streamlined business validation prevents errors while maintaining data integrity.

**Verification**: Console logs confirm that `renderCartItem` now correctly receives and displays product names (e.g., "Fresh Rubber Shirt") instead of displaying "Unknown Product".

#### Order Creation Flow Fixes (RLS enforcement, column mapping, details normalization)

- **What were we trying to do**: Ensure customers/admins can create orders from the cart reliably and that order details render in the UI.
- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**:
  1. Manual membership pre-check in `packages/shared/api/orders.ts:createOrderFromCart` rejected admins with "User is not associated with this business" because admins aren’t `members`.
  2. `order_items` insert used non-existent column `price_at_order` (schema uses `price_at_time_of_order`).
  3. UI expected `price_at_order` when reading order details; DB returns `price_at_time_of_order`.
  4. Order history sorted by non-existent `order_date`.
- **How the change addresses the root cause**:
  1. Removed the membership pre-check; rely on DB RLS to authorize inserts for all roles.
  2. Changed insert payload to `price_at_time_of_order`.
  3. Mapped `price_at_time_of_order` to `price_at_order` in `getOrderDetails` for UI compatibility.
  4. Switched order history sorting to `created_at`.
- **Why the change addresses the root cause**: Centralizes authorization in RLS (avoids false rejections), fixes column mismatch that caused insert failures, normalizes field naming for the UI, and prevents sort errors due to a missing column.

#### B2C Order UX and Routing Fixes

- **What were we trying to do**: Fix lack of feedback on “Create Order”, prevent redirect to Home after order creation, and make the Orders tab show actual user orders.
- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**:
  1. `apps/b2c/app/_layout.tsx` redirected non-tab routes; `order-confirmation` and `orders` weren’t allow-listed, causing unexpected navigation to Home.
  2. The Orders tab screen was a placeholder; the real list lived at `apps/b2c/app/orders/index.tsx` and used a hardcoded `'current_user_id'`, returning empty results.
  3. The “Create Order” button didn’t show a loading state, so users couldn’t tell if submission succeeded.
  4. Order details UI assumed always-present addresses and `order_date`.
- **How the change addresses the root cause**:
  1. Updated `_layout.tsx` to allow `order-confirmation` and `orders` routes for authenticated users.
  2. Implemented the orders list in `apps/b2c/app/(tabs)/orders.tsx` using `supabase.auth.getUser()` and `getCustomerOrderHistory(user.id)` with loading/error/empty states; changed `apps/b2c/app/orders/index.tsx` to redirect to the tabbed screen.
  3. Added `placingOrder` state in `apps/b2c/app/cart.tsx` to disable the button and show a spinner during submission.
  4. Hardened `apps/b2c/app/orders/[id].tsx` to fall back to `created_at` for the date and render addresses only if present.
- **Why the change addresses the root cause**: Ensures correct navigation to confirmation, visible progress during order submission, and accurate, authenticated order fetching for the Orders tab while preventing UI crashes on optional fields.

### Session: Saturday, August 9, 2025

#### Add testing plan documentation

- **What were we trying to do**: Capture a clear, dependency-ordered plan to implement unit, integration, and screen tests tailored to the Expo RN monorepo.
- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**: Created `docs/test_setup.md` to centralize the test strategy, tooling, file structure, scripts, utilities, and a task checklist. This addresses prior ambiguity about how to structure tests across `apps/b2c` and `packages/shared` after Jest setup was stabilized.
- **How the change addresses the root cause**: Provides concrete steps (with dependencies) to add testing utilities, write unit/integration/screen tests, and wire CI/coverage, reducing ramp-up time and ensuring consistent patterns.
- **Why the change addresses the root cause**: A documented plan prevents ad-hoc test implementation, aligns contributors, and accelerates adding reliable tests without re-solving environment issues.

#### Monorepo Jest Testing Setup for Expo RN (B2C and Shared)

- **What were we trying to do**: Establish a working Jest setup for the Expo React Native monorepo so that tests run in `apps/b2c` and `packages/shared` under pnpm.

- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**:
  1. Tests failed with `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` from Expo's Winter runtime (`expo/src/winter/index.ts`) because Expo packages were not being transformed by Babel in Jest.
  2. Jest config attempted to map `@react-native/js-polyfills/error-guard`, but the mock file did not exist at the repository root, causing a configuration error.
  3. Shared package tests encountered resolution issues for `NativeAnimatedHelper` and a failing assertion when rendering string children in `Button` without a wrapping `Text`.

- **How the change addresses the root cause**:
  1. Updated `transformIgnorePatterns` in both `apps/b2c/jest.config.js` and `packages/shared/jest.config.js` to include `expo` and `@expo` alongside RN-related packages, ensuring Expo sources are transformed by `babel-jest`.
  2. Added a root mock module at `__mocks__/@react-native/js-polyfills/error-guard.js` and mapped it in both Jest configs to satisfy RN's test setup.
  3. Hardened `packages/shared/jest-setup.js` to optionally mock `react-native/Libraries/Animated/NativeAnimatedHelper` without crashing if resolution fails under pnpm.
  4. Adjusted `packages/shared/components/Button.tsx` so string/number children are wrapped in a `Text` component, allowing reliable text queries in tests.

- **Why the change addresses the root cause**:
  1. Transforming Expo modules removes the ESM parsing error under Jest.
  2. Providing the error-guard mock resolves RN's setup requirement across workspaces.
  3. Making the NativeAnimatedHelper mock resilient avoids environment-specific resolution errors.
  4. Wrapping string children in `Text` matches RN expectations and enables deterministic testing with React Native Testing Library.

- **Verification**: `pnpm test` passes across workspaces; `apps/b2c` and `packages/shared` suites are green.

#### Stabilize Jest for shared package; remove async-storage dependency in tests; mock expo-constants; align Supabase mocking

- **What were we trying to do**: Run the monorepo tests from the root reliably and eliminate failures caused by RN/Expo ESM modules and unnecessary dependencies in the shared package tests.
- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**:
  1. Shared tests failed resolving `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`. We decided it’s not needed at this stage and removed any reliance on it in the shared setup.
  2. ESM parse errors from `expo-constants` occurred in Jest. Added an explicit mock for `expo-constants` in `packages/shared/jest-setup.js` to avoid importing ESM modules under Jest.
  3. Dynamic `import()` in tests triggered `--experimental-vm-modules` issues. Converted test imports to `require()` for stability.
  4. Supabase mocking relied on a hoisted `jest.mock` factory capturing outer variables, which Jest disallows. Switched to `jest.mock('@supabase/supabase-js', () => ({ createClient: jest.fn() }))` and stubbing `createClient` to a local mock client per test.
- **How the change addresses the root cause**:
  1. Removing async-storage usage eliminates a brittle dependency and resolution errors.
  2. Mocking `expo-constants` avoids ESM parsing at test time while preserving expected config shape.
  3. Using CommonJS `require` sidesteps VM module flags in Jest.
  4. Directly mocking `createClient` removes hoist-time variable capture, making Supabase mocks deterministic.
- **Why the change addresses the root cause**: These adjustments target the exact compatibility issues between Expo/RN modules and Jest’s Node test runtime, resulting in stable test execution in the monorepo.
- **Notes/Follow-up**: Two shared tests still fail due to expectation mismatches with current implementation (initial `from('products')` call before a guard; `null` vs `undefined` for absent joined product). Pending a product decision, either adjust implementation to be stricter or align tests with current behavior.

### Session: Sunday, August 10, 2025

#### Lazy Supabase getter, products API refactor, and deterministic module-level mocking in tests

- **What were we trying to do**: Fix remaining `packages/shared` product API test failures caused by module-load timing and non-chainable query builder behavior while keeping production code clean.
- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**:
  1. Root cause: importing a prebuilt `supabase` at module load made tests brittle (mocking `createClient` after import had no effect). Also, the mocked builder became non-chainable/thenable after `select('*')` in some paths.
  2. Introduced `getSupabase()` lazy getter in `packages/shared/api/supabase.ts` to initialize the client on first use and avoid eager construction during module import.
  3. Updated `packages/shared/api/products.ts` to use `getSupabase()` for `getProducts` and `getProductById`, and added a short-circuit for missing `business_id` before building queries.
  4. Standardized a chainable and awaitable Supabase query builder in `packages/shared/testing/supabase.mock.ts`.
  5. In tests, mocked `getSupabase()` at module-load time using `jest.isolateModules` + `jest.doMock('../supabase', () => ({ getSupabase: () => client }))` before requiring the module under test.
- **How the change addresses the root cause**: Lazy initialization removes dependency on import order; tests inject the client deterministically. The chainable/awaitable builder mirrors Supabase’s API, allowing assertions on call order and args while supporting `await` on the final query.
- **Why the change addresses the root cause**: Avoids brittle ESM/hoisting pitfalls, matches real API ergonomics, and keeps production code unwarped for tests.
- **Verification**: All `packages/shared` products tests pass (status filtering, missing `business_id` short-circuit, `getProductById` success/error). Remaining mismatches are in `orders` tests (`product` null vs undefined; first table hit expectations).
