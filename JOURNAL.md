#### B2C Product Visibility Fix

- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**: The B2C application failed to display products for logged-in users. The root cause was traced to the `getCustomerBusinessId` function, which could not reliably fetch the `business_id` when a user was a member of multiple businesses, as the `.single()` database query would fail.
- **How the change addresses the root cause**:
  1.  A new, more robust function, `getBusinessIdForUser`, was created in `packages/shared/api/profiles.ts`. This function uses `.limit(1).single()` to ensure it gracefully handles users with multiple business associations by returning the first available `business_id`.
  2.  The product display component at `apps/b2c/app/(tabs)/products.tsx` was updated to use the new `getBusinessIdForUser` function.
- **Why the change addresses the root cause**: The `getBusinessIdForUser` function guarantees that a valid `business_id` is always returned for any logged-in user, allowing the application to consistently fetch and display the product catalog. This resolves the visibility issue and makes the B2C app functional again, as verified with Playwright testing.

#### Routing Fix, Header Configuration Refactoring, Tab Removal, and Dependency Update

- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**:
  1.  **Routing Fix**: The `useEffect` hook in `apps/b2b/app/_layout.tsx` was causing an infinite redirection loop after user login, preventing navigation to other tabs.
  2.  **Header Configuration Refactoring**: Header options were redundantly defined in individual tab screens, leading to potential conflicts and scattered control.
  3.  **Tab Removal**: The "Customers" tab was present but not part of the B2B application's initial intended functionality.
  4.  **Dependency Update**: `expo-router` was at `^5.1.1`, and a minor version update to `5.1.3` was available, likely containing bug fixes or performance improvements.
- **How the change addresses the root cause**:
  1.  **Routing Fix**: A check (`if (!inTabsGroup)`) was added to the `useEffect` hook to ensure redirection to `/(tabs)` only occurs if the user is not already within the `(tabs)` group. This allows `expo-router`'s `Tabs` component to handle internal tab navigation correctly. Additionally, `<Stack.Screen name="(tabs)" options={{ headerShown: false }} />` was added to the main `Stack` component to properly register the `(tabs)` group and hide its header.
  2.  **Header Configuration Refactoring**: `Stack.Screen` header options were removed from individual tab screens (`apps/b2b/app/(tabs)/inventory.tsx`, `apps/b2b/app/(tabs)/orders.tsx`, `apps/b2b/app/(tabs)/products.tsx`). Header control is now centralized at the `(tabs)/_layout.tsx` or main `_layout.tsx` level.
  3.  **Tab Removal**: The "Customers" tab was removed from `apps/b2b/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`.
  4.  **Dependency Update**: The `expo-router` dependency was updated from `^5.1.1` to `5.1.3` in `apps/b2b/package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- **Why the change addresses the root cause**:
  1.  **Routing Fix**: Prevents the infinite redirection, allowing proper navigation within the B2B application and improving user experience.
  2.  **Header Configuration Refactoring**: Centralizes header management, making the codebase cleaner, more maintainable, and preventing conflicting header definitions.
  3.  **Tab Removal**: Streamlines the application by removing unused functionality, aligning it with the project's current scope.
  4.  **Dependency Update**: Ensures the application benefits from the latest bug fixes and performance improvements in `expo-router`.

#### Debug Journal: B2C Product Display Issue Investigation and Test File Cleanup

- **What was changed/decided and why (root cause/reason)**: Investigated why the B2C app showed "No products found" for unauthenticated users. The root cause was identified as an RLS policy on products requiring authentication and the B2C app's inability to determine the business context without an authenticated user. This led to a decision to clean up test files to focus on relevant tests for this issue.
- **How the change addresses the root cause**: This entry documents the problem, root cause analysis, and potential solutions. It also details the decision to remove irrelevant test files (`check_members_roles.js`, `temp_check_members_distribution.js`, `diagnostic.js`, `diagnostic_direct.js`, `diagnostic_frontend.js`) and keep relevant ones (`test_frontend_products.js`, `test_simple_products.js`, `test_direct_api.js`, `test_connection.js`) to streamline debugging and future development.
- **Why the change addresses the root cause**: By understanding the RLS policy and business ID resolution issues, a clear path for solution (modifying RLS or requiring authentication) is established. Cleaning up test files ensures that future testing efforts are focused and efficient, directly supporting the resolution of the product display issue.
