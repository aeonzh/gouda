## 1. What is the reason of not having a total_amount for "cart" table

## 2. What is the reason to have "pending review" and "published" product status?

Does it mean that all products need to be approved by a system admin?
I want the business owners to be able to manage their own shops as independently as possible. This should be reflected in the "products" table RLS

## 3. Use soft-delete everywhere. Only let the admin actually delete items in the database

## 4. Use the notation **INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE** where applicable in RLS
