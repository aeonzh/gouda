## Key areas

For the design of the B2B wholesale store platform with separate sides for the store manager and the customer, we should consider the following key areas:

1. **User Authentication and Authorization**:
   1. How will users (both managers and customers) log in?
   2. How will we differentiate their permissions and access levels?
2. **Data Model**:
   1. What are the core entities we need to represent? (e.g., Products, Orders, Customers/customers, Stores, Inventory, Pricing).
   2. How will they relate to each other?
3. **Store Manager Side**:
   1. What functionalities does the store manager need? (e.g., managing products, inventory, orders, customer accounts, setting prices, generating reports).
4. **Customer Side**:
   1. What functionalities does the customer need? (e.g., browsing products, placing orders, viewing order history, managing their profile, potentially managing multiple shipping addresses or payment methods).
5. **Order Processing**:
   1. How will orders be placed, confirmed, processed, and tracked?
6. **Search and Filtering**:
   1. How will users find products effectively?

### Optional

1. **Pricing and Discounts**:
   1. How will wholesale pricing, tiered pricing, or specific customer discounts be handled?
