# Buyer Application PRD

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the requirements for the Buyer application, a mobile application designed to serve as the primary interface for buyers interacting with the B2B wholesale store platform. The application will allow buyers to browse products, create orders, manage their accounts, and view their order history.

## 2. Core Requirements

- Enable buyers to register and log in securely.
- Provide a clear and intuitive way for buyers to discover and view products.
- Allow buyers to add products to a shopping cart and create an order from it.
- Provide access to past order history and status updates.
- Allow buyers to manage their profile information and shipping addresses.

## 3. Core Features

- **Authentication:** User registration, login, and password reset.
- **Product Catalog:** Browse products by category, search, filter, and view detailed product information (including pricing and availability).
- **Shopping Cart:** Add, remove, and update product quantities in the cart.
- **Order Creation:** Create an order directly from the shopping cart.
- **Order History:** View a list of past orders with details and status.
- **User Profile:** View and edit personal information, manage shipping addresses.

## 4. Core Components

- Authentication forms (Login, Sign Up, Forgot Password)
- Product listing and detail components
- Search bar and filtering options
- Shopping cart interface
- Order creation confirmation
- Order history list and detail views
- User profile forms for editing personal information and managing shipping addresses.

## 5. App/User Flow

A typical user flow would involve:

1. User opens the app and logs in (or signs up).
2. User browses the product catalog or searches for specific products.
3. User views product details and adds items to the shopping cart.
4. User proceeds to the shopping cart to review selected items.
5. User creates an order directly from the shopping cart.
6. User receives an order confirmation.
7. User can view the order status in their order history.
8. User can access their profile to update personal information or manage shipping addresses.

## 6. Tech Stack

The Buyer application will be built using:

- React Native
- Expo
- NativeWind (for styling)

## 7. Implementation Plan

The implementation will follow an iterative approach, starting with core functionalities and progressively adding more features. The initial focus will be on:

1. Setting up the project environment with React Native, Expo, and NativeWind.
2. Implementing the authentication screens and logic.
3. Developing the core product browsing and viewing features.
4. Building the shopping cart functionality.
5. Implementing the simplified order creation process directly from the shopping cart.
6. Developing the order history and user profile screens, including the ability to manage shipping addresses.
7. Integrating with the backend API for data fetching and submission.
8. Thorough testing and debugging.

Subsequent iterations will focus on adding features like payment method management (if introduced later), wishlists, notifications, and potentially more advanced search and filtering options.
