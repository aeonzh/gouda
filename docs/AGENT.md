## Application Description

This application is a mobile project built using the **Expo** framework and **React Native** for cross-platform development. It uses **Expo Router** for defining application routes based on the file structure, providing a clear and organized navigation pattern. The codebase is written in **TypeScript**, enhancing code quality and developer productivity through static typing. For styling, it employs **NativeWind** and **Tailwind CSS**, enabling a utility-first approach to design. The inclusion of the **Supabase** dependency strongly indicates that the application interacts with Supabase for backend functionalities, which likely includes database operations, authentication, and potentially other services like storage or real-time subscriptions.

The application's specific purpose, based on the available files like `app/cart.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/orders.tsx`, and `app/stores/[storeId].tsx`, appears to be related to e-commerce or a store-based system, potentially involving browsing stores, viewing items, managing a cart, and handling orders.

## Tech Stack

*   **Framework:** Expo
*   **UI Library:** React Native
*   **Routing:** Expo Router
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** NativeWind, Tailwind CSS
*   **Backend (Likely):** Supabase

## Getting Started

To get started with the application:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
```
bash
    pnpm install
    
```
2.  **Start the application:**
```
bash
    pnpm start
    
```
Once started, you can open the app in a development build, Android emulator, iOS simulator, or Expo Go.

## Folder structure

The app folder seems to contain the main application screens and navigation logic, leveraging Expo Router's file-based routing. Here's a breakdown of what the files and directories suggest:

- `+not-found.tsx`: This likely handles the display of a 404 "not found" page for routes that don't exist.
- `_layout.tsx`: This file is probably the main layout component for the application, potentially setting up the overall navigation structure or shared UI elements.
- `cart.tsx`: This file likely represents a screen or component related to the user's shopping cart.
- `(auth)`: This is a directory for authentication-related screens.
    - `auth.tsx`: This is likely the main authentication screen, handling login or sign-up.
- `(tabs)`: This directory seems to contain screens that are part of a tab-based navigation interface.
    - `_layout.tsx`: This file probably defines the layout and configuration for the tab navigation.
    - `index.tsx`: This could be the default screen displayed when the user is in the tabs section (e.g., a home screen).
    - `orders.tsx`: This file likely displays a list of the user's orders.
    - `profile.tsx`: This file probably shows the user's profile information.
- `orders/[id].tsx`: This indicates a dynamic route for displaying individual order details, where `[id]` is a placeholder for the order ID.
-` stores/[storeId].tsx`: This suggests a dynamic route for displaying individual store details, with `[storeId]` as a placeholder for the store ID.
- `stores/[storeId]/[itemId].tsx`: This further nested dynamic route is likely for displaying details of a specific item within a particular store, using both `[storeId]` and `[itemId]` as placeholders.

Overall, the app folder structure points to a mobile application with features for authentication, a tabbed interface (possibly for home, orders, and profile), a shopping cart, and dynamic routing for displaying details of orders, stores, and store items.
