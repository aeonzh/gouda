# Notes

Compile those findings into a PRD. Use markdown format. It should contain the
following sections:

- Project overview
- Core requirements
- Core features
- Core components
- App/user flow
- Techstack
- Implementation plan

Based on the generated PRD, create a detailed step-by-step plan to build this project.
Then break it down into small tasks that build on each other.
Based on those tasks, break them into smaller subtasks.
Make sure the steps are small enough to be implemented in a step but big enough
to finish the project with success.
Use best practices of software development and project management, no big
complexity jumps. Wire tasks into others, creating a dependency list. There
should be no orphan tasks.

VERY IMPORTANT:

- Use markdown or asciidoc
- Each task and subtask should be a checklist item
- Provide context enough per task so a developer should be able to implement it
- Each task should have a number id
- Each task should list dependent task ids
