# Gouda Project - Detailed Implementation Plan

This document outlines a detailed step-by-step plan for building the Gouda B2B wholesale store platform, encompassing both the Buyer and Administrative mobile applications, and their underlying backend infrastructure. The plan is broken down into phases, tasks, and subtasks, with dependencies clearly identified.

## Project Overview

The Gouda project aims to develop a B2B wholesale store platform consisting of two main mobile applications:

1.  **Buyer Application**: A mobile interface for buyers to browse products, create orders, manage accounts, and view order history.
2.  **Administrative Application**: A mobile interface for store managers and seller agents to manage products, inventory, orders, buyers, and administrative users, with role-based functionalities.

Both applications will be built using React Native, Expo, and NativeWind for styling, supported by a robust backend API, with Supabase as the chosen backend-as-a-service.
