# Application Description

This application is a mobile project built using the **Expo** framework and **React Native** for cross-platform development. It uses **Expo Router** for defining application routes based on the file structure, providing a clear and organized navigation pattern. The codebase is written in **TypeScript**, enhancing code quality and developer productivity through static typing. For styling, it employs **NativeWind** and **Tailwind CSS**, enabling a utility-first approach to design. The inclusion of the **Supabase** dependency strongly indicates that the application interacts with Supabase for backend functionalities, which likely includes database operations, authentication, and potentially other services like storage or real-time subscriptions.
